This mid-sized rural town has been called the "Heart of the Inner Banks". It has a range of historical buildings and landmarks that add to its architectural interest, with some dating back to colonial times. A self-guided Historic Walking Tour allows visitors to explore the neighborhoods. Homes of Victorian design, Arts and Crafts, and traditional early-20th century dwellings stand side-by-side on sidewalks lined with crepe myrtle trees. Condominiums and townhouses have been constructed on the city's waterfront to bring residents back to the river, the town's starting place. A Farmer's and Artisan's Market is held regularly on the town's green areas on the waterfront.
