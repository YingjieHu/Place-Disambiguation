Nearly everyone who has driven south to the Gulf Coast beaches knows about Greenville - or thinks he does.  But to really know Greenville, you need to put down that interstate map and stop in for a visit.

Located just half an hour south of Montgomery - where I-65, U.S. 31 and Alabama's Highway 10 converge - Greenville is the county seat of picturesque Butler County. Montgomery Regional Airport is just minutes away, and CSX rail serves the city.

Greenville is proud of its historic downtown business and residential district, and its wide variety of other retail and commercial offerings. The city's industrial manufacturing base is diverse, from wood products and steering wheels to textiles, and it's rapidly growing.
