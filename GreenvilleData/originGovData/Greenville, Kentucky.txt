Located among the rolling hills of Western Kentucky, Greenville extends true southern hospitality to all who visit. Whether you attend one of our special events, visit the local eateries, or browse for specialty items in some of our unique shops, your visit will be most memorable. 
As the county seat for Muhlenberg County, the historic square is anchored with a beautiful 100+ year old court house that plays hostess to Kentucky’s second largest clock/bell tower dome and the largest pre-fabricated Cupola in the United States! The quaint downtown is lined with historic light poles and new sidewalks. As you stroll through downtown you will be serenaded by the charming sounds of acoustic music that is piped in 24 hours a day via speakers on every light pole. Greenville is also blessed with a wide variety of unique shops in and out of the downtown area that include gift shops, cosmetic stores, fine women’s apparel, high end jewelry, and antiques. 
In addition, Greenville is rapidly becoming a regional hub for classic small town festivals and events. Events are held throughout the year and include “Saturdays on the Square,” a summer concert series voted a Top Ten Event by the Kentucky Travel Industry, “Squash & Gobble Arts Bazaar & Fall Festival,” “Twi-Light Antique Car Show,” annual Christmas Parade, multiple merchant events and the list could go on and on.
