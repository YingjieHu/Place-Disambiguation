History[edit]
The town was settled in 1799 on an estate donated by local landowner William Campbell in order to establish a seat of government for a new county. Greenville was not established by the state assembly until 1812, however.[2] It was incorporated as a city in 1848.[3]

The city was probably named for the Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene,[4] although local lore holds it was named by Campbell's wife after the abundant forests seen from the town's hilltop location.[2]
